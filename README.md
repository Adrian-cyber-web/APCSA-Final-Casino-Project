//Hello to who ever is reading this. This project was my final for AP computer science A where we were tasked to create a game of our choosing 
//This game was not made entirely by me but with the help of a classmate and friend. I wanted to publish this in the hopes that it may help someone currently taking or who will take this class late in the future
//This game is suppose to simulate a casino allthough not the best we only had a week to create this game and along with studying for other finals we didnt have much time to completely polish it however i think it
//came out pretty well for the hand we were dealt:) however i hope that i will serve some use to somebody one day
//this game was created entirely with java and was used on an enviroement called pickcode which was a website our teacher told us to use. Hopefully it can help somebody get started on a similar project by inspiring them or if you want
//you can just copy and submit this project as i cant really blame you as ive done similar. Thank you for reading hope you have a nice day, and if we dont meet again have a nice life :)
